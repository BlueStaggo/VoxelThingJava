# TODO List

Current goal: create a game akin to Minecraft Classic with building and destruction in an infinitely generated world.

Key:
- ðŸ¤” Thinking faces denote features that may not be implemented, but they may be worked on.

## Rendering
- [x] Frustum culling
- [x] Advanced block textures (e.g. grass sides)
- [ ] 2D immediate mode renderer (for guis)
- [x] 3D immediate mode renderer (for entities)
- [ ] Clouds

## Gameplay
- [x] Player entity with physics
- [ ] Block building and destruction
- [ ] ðŸ¤” Block ID flattening? It takes up more memory, but it should not affect performance much.
- [ ] World saving and loading
