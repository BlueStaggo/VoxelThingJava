![VOXEL THING](doc/logo.png)
## Your generic barebones clone of a really popular block game
Nothing much here yet, huh? What will this be? A standalone version of [Diverge](https://github.com/BlueStaggo/MCDiverge)? An Alpha equivalent of [ClassiCube](https://classicube.net)? Who knows? It may be leaning most towards being a standalone version of Diverge, a mod created by the same author as this random, uhh, voxel thing. It will feature multiplayer and it will be free to play if it turns into a full on game.
