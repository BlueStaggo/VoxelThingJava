![VOXEL THING](doc/logo.png)
## Your generic barebones clone of a really popular block game
Nothing much here yet, huh? What will this be? Well, it is heading towards being some sort of standalone version of [Diverge](https://github.com/BlueStaggo/MCDiverge), a mod created by the same author as this random, uhh, voxel thing. A couple other people are helping out as well by taking inspiration from their idea of a game (called Player 11 for some reason). This game might feature furry content, like how [DangerZone](https://orespawn.com) has anti-vax content, who knows? Voxel Thing will feature multiplayer and it will be free to play if it turns into a full on game.
